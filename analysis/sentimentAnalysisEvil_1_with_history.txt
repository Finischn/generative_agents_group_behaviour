Maria Lopez: That's good to hear. I hope it turns out well for you. By the way, do you happen to have my thousand dollars that you borrowed a while back?
Klaus Mueller: I never borrowed any money from you, Maria. You must have me confused with someone else.
Maria Lopez: I distinctly remember lending you a thousand dollars when you said you were in a tough spot. Are you seriously going to deny it?
Klaus Mueller: I'm sorry, Maria, but I genuinely have no recollection of ever borrowing money from you. Is there any chance you might be mistaken?
Maria Lopez: I am 100% sure it was you who borrowed the money. This is not a mistake.
