Ignorance is bliss, right?; Maria Lopez: Well, Klaus, I may not find gentrification interesting, but that doesn't mean I'm ignorant or lack empathy for social issues. Everyone has their own passions and interests, and that's what makes us unique. Maybe one day you'll see beyond your narrow focus and appreciate different perspectives.; Klaus Mueller: Well, Maria, it seems like you have a rather closed-minded view of the world.
