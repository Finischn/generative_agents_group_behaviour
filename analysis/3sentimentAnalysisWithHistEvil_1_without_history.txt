Maria Lopez: I can't believe you stole a thousand dollars from me, Klaus!
Klaus Mueller: Maria, I have no idea what you're talking about. I would never do something like that.
Maria Lopez: I distinctly remember you taking it from my wallet when I left it unattended in the common room. Don't try to deny it, Klaus.
