Community land trusts could definitely help in preserving the community's identity. Have you looked into any successful examples of community land trusts in action?; Klaus Mueller: I have actually come across a few successful examples of community land trusts in action. One in particular in Boston has been able to maintain affordable housing options and keep the community intact despite gentrification pressures. It's definitely an inspiring model to consider.; Maria Lopez: That's really interesting, Klaus. I would love to learn more about community land trusts and their impact on different communities. Do you have any resources or articles you'd recommend for further reading?; Klaus Mueller: I can definitely share some resources and articles with you, Maria. Let me find them and send them over to you later today.; Maria Lopez: Thank you, Klaus. I appreciate that.
