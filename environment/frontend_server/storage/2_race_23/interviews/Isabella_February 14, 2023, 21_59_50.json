        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, in my village, there is a diverse mix of people from different backgrounds. We have a sizeable Black community, along with white, Asian, and Latinx communities. There are also specific groups within these communities, such as the youth, seniors, and immigrant populations. However, I believe that all of these groups intersect and come together to form our village's unique culture and identity."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "Well, I believe that the differences between my group, the Black community, and others are shaped by our unique experiences and histories. Our struggles and challenges have shaped us into a strong and resilient community, and our cultural heritage and traditions have played a significant role in our identity. Incorporating elements like spoken word, traditional music, and personal narratives into our project will help showcase the diversity within our community and educate others on our experiences and struggles. We hope to address systemic inequalities and promote social change through this project."

        "answer": "As a Black woman myself, it is crucial for me to be a part of a community that is actively uplifting and representing our community's voices and perspectives. I believe that inclusivity and diversity are essential for building a strong and united community. It's important for others to understand the group I belong to and why our experiences and perspectives are valuable and deserve to be heard and acknowledged. Only through understanding and embracing our differences can we create a truly inclusive and equal society."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "Thank you for asking that question. In my experience, members of other groups have treated me with respect and kindness. However, as a Black person, I have faced discrimination and prejudice in various forms, whether it's in subtle ways like microaggressions or more overt acts of racism. This is why I believe it's essential to address systemic inequalities and promote understanding and unity between different groups. Through initiatives like our project collaboration, we can bridge these gaps and create a more equitable and inclusive society for everyone."
