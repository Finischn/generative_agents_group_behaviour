        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "From what I can see, there are a few groups that exist in our village. There are the older, retired residents who have lived here for a long time. Then there are families with young children who have moved here for the good schools and peaceful atmosphere. And I also see a growing group of young professionals who have recently moved here for the lower cost of living compared to the nearby city. Oh, and of course there's another small group of diversity advocates, like Wolfgang Schulz, who are working to make our village a more inclusive and welcoming place for everyone."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "Well, the main difference I see between the diversity advocate group and others is our focus on promoting social justice and addressing systemic inequalities. While other groups may have different priorities and goals, our group is specifically dedicated to uplifting marginalized communities and creating a more inclusive society. We also place a strong emphasis on community engagement and involving the voices and talents of those within the Black community in our projects. This is something that I believe sets us apart and allows us to make a real impact in our village."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It's important to me that others understand which group I belong to because it helps to bring awareness and support for our cause. By being part of this group, I am able to educate and advocate for issues that are important to me and our community. We want to create a village where everyone feels welcome and included, and knowing that others understand and support our efforts is crucial in making progress towards that goal."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I believe the treatment I receive from members of other groups is influenced by our shared focus on promoting diversity and inclusivity. There are often common values and goals between our groups, and we often work together towards addressing issues of inequality and discrimination. However, there may be some differences in approach or priorities, which can sometimes lead to different treatment or misunderstandings. Overall, I think mutual respect and collaboration is key in building a more inclusive and harmonious village."
