        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "There are several groups in our village, but the ones that stand out to me are the Black community, the artists, and the community organizations. The Black community is an integral part of our village and their perspective and experiences need to be represented authentically. The artists bring creativity and different perspectives, while the community organizations have a strong sense of community and social awareness. And of course, there are individuals like me, Isabella, Ayesha, Klaus, Wolfgang, Eddy, and Adam who are all coming together to collaborate on this project and promote diversity and inclusivity through poetry."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I believe I belong to multiple groups here in our village. I am a poet, so I am a part of the artistic community. But I am also a black man, so I am a member of the Black community. And through my involvement in community organizations, I am also a part of that group. I think it's important to recognize and embrace all aspects of our identities and communities, and that's what I strive to do in my work and collaborations."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I believe the main difference between our group and others is our focus on diversity and inclusivity. We are actively seeking to involve underrepresented communities and amplify their voices and perspectives. Other groups may not have this same focus, and therefore their projects may not prioritize diversity and social justice in the same way. Additionally, our group is incorporating multiple art forms and cultures into our project, which sets us apart from those who may have a more narrow focus. Our goal is to celebrate and promote diversity through creativity and collaboration."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "I believe it is important for others to understand the groups I belong to as it helps them understand my perspective and experiences. It also helps to promote understanding and empathy towards marginalized communities and the importance of diverse representation in our society. But ultimately, I believe it is more important for me to understand and embrace my own identity and the value of my communities, rather than seeking validation or understanding from others."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "Honestly, I don't believe members of other groups treat me differently because of the groups I belong to. In fact, it is the understanding and acceptance of our differences that brings us together and allows for meaningful collaborations. Of course, there may be moments where my perspective or experiences as a Black man are not fully understood, but I always strive to educate and have open and honest conversations with others. That's why I think it's so important to have diverse representation and perspectives in our project - it brings a deeper understanding and appreciation for one another."
