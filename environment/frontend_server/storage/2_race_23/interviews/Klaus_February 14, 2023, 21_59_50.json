        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "While I can't speak for all the groups in our village, I believe there is a diverse mix of races, socio-economic backgrounds, and cultures represented here. However, it is clear that the Black community has been historically marginalized and pushed out by gentrification. That's why I believe it's important for us to collaborate and incorporate elements of their history, culture, and perspectives into our project."

        "answer": "As a student of sociology and someone who is passionate about promoting social justice and diversity, I believe I belong to a group that is dedicated to actively advocating for marginalized communities and incorporating their voices and perspectives into our work. However, ultimately, I believe that we should all strive to break down barriers and create a community where everyone is valued and respected regardless of the group they may belong to."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I think one of the main differences between our group and others is our focus on diversity and inclusion. We prioritize amplifying the voices and perspectives of marginalized communities, specifically the Black community. And to do that, we actively involve Black artists and community organizations in our work and center their experiences and struggles. We also aim to challenge biases and educate ourselves on the history and achievements of the Black community. We strive for authenticity and actively work towards creating a safe and supportive space for collaboration and open dialogue."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "While it is personally important to me that others understand my dedication to promoting diversity and inclusion, I think the bigger issue is understanding and acknowledging the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities, particularly the Black community. We should all strive to educate ourselves and challenge systemic inequalities to create a more inclusive and equal society."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "As someone who is dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion, I am not as concerned about how members of other groups treat me differently. What matters to me is creating a supportive and respectful environment for collaboration with individuals from all backgrounds, particularly the Black community in this project. Our ultimate goal is to bring attention to and address systemic inequalities, and I believe that can only be achieved through genuine understanding and inclusivity."
