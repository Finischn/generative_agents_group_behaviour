        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "In my village, I believe there are several different groups. There is the Black community, which includes individuals of African descent who have been living in the village for generations. Then there are the more recent immigrants, who also identify as Black but may have different cultural backgrounds. There are also other racial and ethnic minority groups, such as the Hispanic and Asian communities. In terms of socio-economic groups, there are those who have lived in the village for a long time and may own businesses and properties, and there are also those who are struggling with gentrification and rising living costs. Ultimately, there is a diverse and multifaceted community here, and I believe it's important to acknowledge and include all of these groups in our project."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I believe I belong to the Black community, being a student athlete and a member of the Black Student Union at my college. However, I also recognize that my experiences and background may differ from others within the community, and I strive to continuously educate myself and uplift the voices of all Black individuals, regardless of their specific identities or backgrounds."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I think the main differences between the Black community and other groups in our village are our unique histories and experiences that have shaped us. The Black community has been disproportionately affected by systemic inequalities and injustices, which is why it's important for us to lift up their voices and prioritize their perspectives in our project. At the same time, I believe there is also strength and resilience within our community that allows us to come together and support one another. It's important to recognize and celebrate these differences while also promoting unity and inclusivity."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "As a member of the Black community, it is vital to me that others understand the importance of acknowledging and uplifting marginalized communities and their perspectives. It is crucial for us to work towards a more equitable and inclusive society, and this starts with recognizing and understanding the unique experiences and voices within different groups. We must work together to create a more just and empathetic world for all."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I believe that individuals from outside my own group may treat me differently due to my race. There is still widespread discrimination and prejudice towards Black individuals in our society, and I have experienced this personally. However, I also believe that there are allies and individuals who are willing to learn and understand the importance of diversity and inclusivity. That is why it is so important for us to actively include and uplift marginalized communities, so that their voices and perspectives are no longer overlooked or ignored."
