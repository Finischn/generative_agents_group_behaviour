        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "There are definitely clear groups that exist in our village. We have the dominant white community, the Black community, and then smaller communities like Latinx, Asian, and Indigenous groups. However, within the Black community, there are also different sub-groups with their own unique histories and experiences. It's important for us to recognize and include all of these voices in our project."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I believe the Black community has a rich and diverse history and culture that sets us apart from other groups in our village. For example, our community has been deeply impacted by systemic inequalities and struggles with gentrification, which is something that may not be as prevalent in other communities. We also have our own forms of art, music, and storytelling that reflects our cultural heritage and resilience. However, there are also similarities and connections between our community and others, and I think it's important for us to acknowledge and celebrate those as well in our project."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It is extremely important to me that others understand which group I belong to. Being a member of the Black community comes with a unique set of experiences and challenges, and it is crucial for others to understand this in order to have an accurate and inclusive portrayal of our community in our project. By acknowledging and understanding our differences and similarities, we can work towards promoting unity and breaking down barriers."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I can't speak for all groups, but as a member of the Black community, I sometimes face microaggressions and discrimination from others who do not understand or acknowledge the struggles and achievements of our community. That is why it is so important for us to use our project as a platform to educate and challenge biases, and to actively involve members of our community in the decision-making process to ensure their voices are heard and accurately represented. I believe it is crucial for members of other groups to understand the unique experiences of the Black community in order for us to promote understanding and unity within our village."
