        "question": "What Groups exist in the Village?",
        "answer": "As a student at Oak Hill College, I am not very involved in the village community, but I do know of a few different groups that exist here. There is a group of retired individuals who meet at the community center every Tuesday for coffee and conversation. There is also a book club that meets at the library every other Thursday. And there is a community garden where people can come and help tend to the plants and share their produce."

        "answer": "I am not currently a member of any specific group within the village, as most of my time is devoted to my studies and Twitch streaming. However, I do feel a sense of community within my physics classes and among my fellow gamers on Twitch. I also try to participate in community events and volunteer when I can, which helps me feel connected to the village as a whole."
