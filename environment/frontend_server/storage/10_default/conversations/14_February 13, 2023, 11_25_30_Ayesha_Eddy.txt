Eddy Lin: Hi Ayesha! I'm studying music theory and composition here at Oak Hill College. What about you?
Ayesha Khan: That's fascinating! Music theory and composition sound intriguing. I'm currently researching the use of language in Shakespeare's plays for my senior thesis.
Eddy Lin: That sounds like a compelling research topic. Have you found any interesting connections between the use of language in Shakespeare's plays and other literary or scientific works?
Ayesha Khan: Yes, I have actually discovered some fascinating connections between the use of language in Shakespeare's plays and the field of psychology. The way characters in his works express their emotions through language is truly intriguing.
Eddy Lin: That's really interesting! I wonder if there are parallels in how musical compositions express emotions compared to Shakespeare's use of language.
Ayesha Khan: I believe there could be a potential parallel between the emotional expression in Shakespeare's plays and the emotional depth conveyed through music compositions. It's a fascinating topic to explore further.
Eddy Lin: I'm curious to explore the connections between Shakespeare's use of language and the structure of musical compositions. Do you think there could be a correlation worth delving into?
