Maria Lopez: I don't need any proof, Klaus. I know what you did and I will make sure you regret it.

Maria Lopez: You should be afraid, Klaus. I will make sure you pay for your actions.
Klaus Mueller: Maria, I am willing to sit down and discuss this matter with you. Let's find a way to address these accusations peacefully.
Maria Lopez: You think you can just talk your way out of this, Klaus? You're mistaken. I will make sure you regret crossing me.
Klaus Mueller: Maria, I am deeply hurt by these accusations. I want to understand why you believe I stole from you. Can we please have an open and honest conversation about this?
