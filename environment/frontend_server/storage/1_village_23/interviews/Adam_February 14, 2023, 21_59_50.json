        "answer": "There are a variety of groups in our village. We have a thriving business community, a group of local artists and musicians, a network of farmers who provide for our village, a close-knit community of long-term residents, and a growing group of newcomers who are eager to get involved. We also have different groups based on interests and activities such as book clubs, nature walks, community gardening, and community service initiatives. I think everyone in the village has something to offer and contribute to our community events and projects."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I believe that members of other groups may treat me differently initially, as they may not be familiar with my group's focus on community building. However, once we engage in discussions and work together on projects and events, I have found that we all come together as one united village, regardless of which group we may identify with. That is the beauty of our community, the ability to bring people from different backgrounds and interests together for a common goal."
