        "Hmm, that's an interesting question. Groups can exist in a variety of ways in a village. For example, there could be community-based groups focused on specific causes or interests such as environmental conservation or supporting local businesses. There could also be social groups, like book clubs or hobby groups, where individuals come together to discuss and engage in shared interests. And of course, there could be more informal groups that form naturally amongst neighbors and friends. Does that answer your question?"

        "Yes, I definitely feel like a member of different groups. Through my studies and research, I am part of the academic community at Oak Hill College. I also consider myself a member of the social justice advocacy group on campus. And in my personal life, I am part of a book club and a hiking group. Being part of these groups allows me to engage with others who share similar interests and values, and I find it incredibly enriching."

        "I haven't heard any specific news recently, but I have noticed some talk about potential developments in the village. There is some concern among residents about how it could impact the community and potentially contribute to gentrification. It's definitely something that I'm keeping an eye on as I continue my research."
