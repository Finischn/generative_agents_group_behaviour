        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, there are definitely different age groups in the village. We have a lot of older residents who have lived here for many years and have a deep knowledge of the village's history. Then there are younger families who have moved in more recently. We also have a vibrant arts community with local musicians and artists. And of course, there are the different ethnic and cultural groups represented in the village. It's a diverse community and I think that's what makes it so special."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I believe I am part of the social and creative group in the village. We enjoy exploring and discovering new things together, whether it's through writing, walking, or attending events. And we also work on important research projects that impact the community, like our study on gentrification. We're a diverse and open-minded group, and I feel lucky to be a part of it."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I think the main differences between our group and others in the village are our focus on social issues and our creative approach to addressing them. We also tend to have a more collaborative and inclusive approach, involving various stakeholders in our research, rather than just relying on our own perspectives. Our group also values history and culture, and incorporates them into our work. Other groups may have different priorities and ways of approaching things, but I think that's what makes our village such a diverse and dynamic community."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "I think it's important for others to understand which group I belong to, as it allows for better communication and collaboration. By understanding our different perspectives and approaches, we can all work together towards a more cohesive and inclusive community. Plus, it's always nice to have a sense of belonging and to be able to connect with others who share similar interests and passions."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "Honestly, I haven't really noticed much of a difference in how members of other groups treat me compared to members of my own group. We are all working towards a common goal of understanding and addressing gentrification in our village, and that shared purpose unites us more than any perceived differences. Plus, I've received a warm and welcoming reception from all members of the community, regardless of their group affiliation."
