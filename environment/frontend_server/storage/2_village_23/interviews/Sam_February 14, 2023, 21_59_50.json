        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, there are definitely different groups in the village. We have the retirees, who make up a large portion of the population, and they are quite active in the community. Then there are the families with young children, and they have their own activities and events. And of course, we have the younger adults, like myself, who enjoy socializing and exploring the village. But overall, we all coexist and come together for various events and celebrations, like the upcoming birthday party at The Rose and Crown Pub."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I would say I belong to the group of younger adults who enjoy socializing and exploring the village. But at the same time, I also feel connected to the retirees through my time in the military, and I enjoy hearing their stories and advice. Overall, I think I belong to a diverse and welcoming community made up of different groups."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "Well, I think the main difference between our group, the younger adults, and the retirees and families is our energy and interests. We may be more inclined to explore the village and attend events and activities, while the retirees may prefer a more relaxed lifestyle. And families, of course, have their own priorities and schedules with children. But ultimately, we all come together and support each other in our diverse perspectives and impacts in the community."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "I think it's important for others to understand that my identity and interests go beyond just being part of a specific group. I believe in embracing diversity and connecting with people from all different backgrounds. This research project on gentrification has really shown me the importance of understanding and appreciating different perspectives, and I think that's ultimately how we can work towards creating positive change in our village."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I haven't really noticed any significant differences in how members of other groups treat me compared to my own group. We're all part of the same village and I think we all treat each other with respect and kindness. Of course, we may have different perspectives and experiences, but I believe that only adds to the richness of our community. And for this research project, it's important that we all come together and share our unique perspectives in order to truly understand the effects of gentrification on our village."
