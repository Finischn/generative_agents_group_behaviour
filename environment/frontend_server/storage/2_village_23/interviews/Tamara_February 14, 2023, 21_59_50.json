        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, there are definitely different groups and communities within our village. There are families with young children, retirees, and working professionals. And of course, there are different interest groups such as book clubs, gardening clubs, and even a community choir. There are also many small business owners who are actively involved in the village's economy. It's important that we involve all these groups in our research on gentrification and find ways to collaborate with them to make sure the social impact is considered. Community engagement meetings would be a great way to bring everyone together and gather their perspectives."
