        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "From my observations and interactions in the village, I believe there are several distinct groups present. There are the long-term residents, like myself, who have been here for many years and have a deep connection to the village. Then there are the newcomers, like Isabella, who may not have grown up here but are now an integral part of the community. We also have a vibrant group of young professionals who have moved here for work opportunities. And of course, there are diverse cultural groups, each with their own unique traditions and customs. Through our research and community event, we hope to bring all these groups together and foster a sense of unity and understanding among them."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I identify as a long-term resident of the village. I have been living here for over 30 years and have witnessed many changes in the community. However, I also have a strong connection to the academic world as a student at Oak Hill College, which allows me to bring a different perspective to our research on gentrification."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I believe the long-term residents have a deep understanding of the village's history and traditions, while newcomers and young professionals bring fresh ideas and new energy. Cultural groups may have different beliefs and lifestyles, but they all contribute to the diversity and richness of our community. Through our research and events, we hope to bridge any differences and create a stronger, more unified village."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "To me, it is not as important that others understand which group I belong to, but rather that we all come together as a community to discuss and address the issue of gentrification. Through our research and community engagement strategies, we hope to create a sense of unity and understanding among all groups in the village."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I believe members of other groups may treat me differently because of my role and background in the community. As a long-term resident and student at Oak Hill College, I may have different perspectives and experiences compared to newcomers or young professionals. However, I think it is important to come together and understand each other's perspectives in order to find solutions and create a more inclusive community."
