        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, there are definitely different groups in our village. There are long-term residents who have been here for years, like myself, and there are more recent newcomers like Adam Smith. There are also different interest groups, such as the art enthusiasts who attend art exhibits and the music lovers who attend music events. And of course, there are the community events like historical landmark tours, cooking classes, and poetry readings that bring people from all groups together. It's a great mix and there's always something new and interesting to do in our village."
