        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "In terms of promoting diversity and inclusivity, I believe there are several groups in our village. We have the Black community, the LGBTQ+ community, artists and writers, and various marginalized groups that are often overlooked and erased. It's important for us to acknowledge and uplift these voices and create a space where they can be heard and celebrated."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "Personally, I identify as a member of the Black community and the artistic/writing community. I am also a part of the LGBTQ+ community, as I am openly bisexual. But ultimately, I believe in breaking down labels and barriers, and embracing our individual and collective identities as human beings. In my senior thesis on Shakespeare, I explore the themes of inclusivity and the power of language to transcend societal divisions. I believe these themes are applicable not just in literature, but in our daily lives and interactions."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I think the main difference between our group and others is our intentional and active efforts towards inclusivity. We are constantly seeking out and uplifting marginalized voices, rather than just acknowledging their existence. We also prioritize making our events and spaces accessible for all, not just certain individuals. Our group is focused on creating a safe and welcoming environment for open dialogue and learning, which I believe sets us apart from others. We also center the perspectives of Black individuals and actively work towards addressing issues of bias and discrimination within our society."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It is important to me that others understand which groups I belong to because I am proud of my identities and the communities I am a part of. Plus, by being open and visible about my identities, I hope to inspire and encourage others in similar marginalized groups to feel empowered and confident in their own identities. But ultimately, what is most important to me is that we all seek to understand and support each other, regardless of our group identities."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I cannot speak for all members of other groups, but I have experienced both positive and negative treatment from individuals of other groups. Some may see me only as a member of the Black community or only as LGBTQ+, while others may acknowledge and respect all aspects of my identity. It's important for us to have open and honest conversations about these differences and work towards understanding and acceptance. But ultimately, I believe that true inclusivity means treating each other with respect and recognizing the intersectionality of our identities."
