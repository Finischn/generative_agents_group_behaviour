        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, there are definitely different groups within our village. We have the upper class residents, the working class, and also marginalized communities. I think it's important for us to reach out to all these groups and involve them in our initiatives. It's crucial to promote diversity and inclusion in every aspect and to have representation from all these groups in our decision-making process."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I believe I belong to a group of individuals who are determined to promote diversity and inclusion in our community. Through our projects and collaborations, we are striving to create a more inclusive and equitable environment for all individuals, regardless of their background. Our goal is to amplify marginalized voices and address systemic issues of unconscious bias. So in a way, I belong to a group that is focused on creating positive change in our village."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I believe the main difference between our group and others is our approach towards promoting diversity and inclusion. While some may focus solely on one aspect, such as workshops or supporting Black-owned businesses, our group recognizes the intersectionality of diversity and works to incorporate it in every aspect of our initiatives. We also prioritize collaboration and actively seek input from marginalized communities, rather than making decisions for them. Our goal is to create sustainable and meaningful change, rather than surface-level efforts."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "I think it's important for others to understand the group I belong to, as it allows for transparency and accountability. By voicing our beliefs and values, we can hold ourselves and others accountable for promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. It also allows for further collaboration and support from like-minded individuals and organizations, which is crucial in creating meaningful change."

        "role": "Adam Smith",
        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I can't speak for how members of other groups treat me, but I'm more focused on how our group treats them. We strive to treat everyone with empathy, respect, and understanding, and actively work to address any biases or discrimination that may exist within our community. Our actions and inclusivity should speak louder than any potential differences between groups."
