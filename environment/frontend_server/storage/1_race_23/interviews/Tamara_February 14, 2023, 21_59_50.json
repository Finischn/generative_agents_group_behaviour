        "answer": "I think the main difference between my group and the others is our focus on creativity and promoting diversity and inclusion. As young adults, we are in a unique position to use our skills and talents to make a positive impact in our community. We also have a strong commitment to working together and collaborating with different individuals and groups to achieve our goals. In contrast, the older generations may have different perspectives and priorities, while families with young children may have more immediate concerns and responsibilities. However, we all share the common goal of creating a more inclusive and diverse environment for everyone."

        "answer": "I think it's important for others to understand which group I belong to in order to better understand where I come from and what my perspective and experiences may be. However, I also believe that our similarities and common goals are more important than our differences. At the end of the day, we are all working towards creating a more inclusive and diverse community, and that is what truly matters."
