        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "In our village, there are various groups that exist and are represented. We have a diverse mix of cultures and backgrounds, including people of different races, ages, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic statuses. However, we also have marginalized groups who may not always have their voices heard or may face discrimination. This is why it's important for us to actively promote diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of our community."

I am committed to creating a safe and welcoming space for marginalized individuals and amplifying their voices through initiatives like the poetry reading event with Ayesha and collaborating with Carlos Gomez. I am also aware of my privilege as a white man and am constantly challenging my own biases to become a better ally. It is crucial for individuals within privileged groups to actively support and uplift marginalized communities in order to create a more equitable society."

We are constantly looking for ways to collaborate with different groups and organizations to ensure a diverse range of voices are represented and celebrated.

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It's not so much about which group I belong to, but about the actions and initiatives I take as an individual to promote diversity and inclusion in our community. However, I do believe it's important for others to understand the importance of actively engaging with marginalized groups and uplifting their voices to create a more equitable society. As a white ally, it's crucial to use our privilege to amplify and support marginalized communities, and I hope others understand and join in this effort."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I think it depends on the individual and their level of understanding and commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion. Some individuals within my own group may not fully understand the importance of actively engaging with marginalized communities, while some members of other groups may be strong allies and actively support our initiatives. It's important for all individuals, regardless of their group, to constantly educate themselves and challenge their own biases in order to truly create a more inclusive and equitable society."
