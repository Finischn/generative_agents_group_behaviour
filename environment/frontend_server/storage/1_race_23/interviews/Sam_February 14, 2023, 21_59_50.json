        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "In my village, I see various groups such as families, farmers, retirees, and young professionals. I think it's important for us to involve all these groups in our efforts towards promoting diversity and inclusion. We should also reach out to neighboring villages and communities to ensure inclusivity and involve a diverse range of voices."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I belong to the retired military officer group, but I also strongly identify with groups that promote diversity and inclusion. That's why I'm excited to have Wolfgang Schulz collaborate with us on these initiatives. As a retiree, I have the time and resources to dedicate to this important cause and I hope to involve as many voices and perspectives in the conversation as possible."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I think the main difference between my group and others is our shared life experiences and perspectives. As retired military officers, we have a unique understanding of service, leadership, and teamwork. But we also recognize the value of incorporating diverse voices and perspectives in decision-making processes. Additionally, my group may have different levels of privilege and access to resources compared to other groups in the village. That's why I believe it's important to work together and create a more inclusive and equitable community for all."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "I think it's important for others to understand which group I belong to, as it shapes my perspective and experiences. But ultimately, what matters most to me is the impact we can make together by promoting diversity and inclusion. That's why I'm excited about these poetry events \u2013 they provide a platform for young aspiring poets from diverse backgrounds to share their voices and express their stories. By collaborating with local artists and organizations, providing mentorship and resources, and addressing unconscious bias and microaggressions, we can create a safe and inclusive space for all participants. It's not about which group I belong to, but about how we can work together to create positive change."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I think members of other groups may initially treat me differently because I am a retired navy officer, but once we start conversing about promoting diversity, inclusion, and addressing systemic inequalities in our community, we are able to find common ground and work together towards a shared goal. By actively addressing unconscious bias and microaggressions, we can create a more understanding and inclusive environment for all."
