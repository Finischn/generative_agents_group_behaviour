        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, in my village, there are people from all walks of life. We have a mix of different races, religions, genders, and ages. I believe it's important to actively involve young Black leaders and collaborate with local organizations to promote diversity and inclusivity in our community. As a Black woman, I understand the importance of representation and support for diverse voices. That's why I always make an effort to engage with Black-owned businesses and artists, collaborate with local organizations, and involve young aspiring poets from diverse backgrounds in our poetry reading events. It's crucial to celebrate and promote diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of our community."

        "answer": "I believe I belong to the Black community and the LGBTQ+ community. As a Black woman, I understand the importance of representation and support for diverse voices. And working on this spoken word event with a focus on Black and LGBTQ+ individuals only solidifies that belief. I think it's important to celebrate and promote diversity within these communities and uplift the voices of those who have been marginalized."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I believe the main difference between my group and others lies in our unique experiences and perspectives. As a Black woman, I have faced discrimination and challenges that someone from a different race or gender may not have experienced. Similarly, members of the LGBTQ+ community face their own set of struggles and obstacles. It's important to recognize and acknowledge these differences and work together to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusion for all groups in our community. In order to create a truly diverse and inclusive community, we must actively involve and amplify the voices of marginalized groups and work towards dismantling systems of oppression."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It is very important to me that others understand which group I belong to because it directly impacts the way I am perceived and treated in society. As a Black woman and a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have faced discrimination and exclusion in the past. By acknowledging and understanding the groups I belong to, others can better empathize with my experiences and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all."

As a result of our discussions and collaborations, I have seen a positive change in attitudes and behaviors towards marginalized communities in our village. It's important to actively listen and engage with each other to promote understanding and inclusivity within and between different groups."
