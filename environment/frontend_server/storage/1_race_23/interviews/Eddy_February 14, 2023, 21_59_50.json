        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "From my observations, there are various groups within our village. Most notably, there is a group of farmers who primarily work on the fields and a group of artisans who specialize in crafting goods. There is also a community of elders who hold important positions in decision-making for the village. As for inhabitants, I know Wolfgang Schulz, who is a skilled blacksmith and a respected member of our village."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I would say I don't necessarily belong to just one group in the village. As a student at Oak Hill College, I am constantly learning from diverse perspectives and incorporating different elements into my work. So, I feel like I am a bridge between different groups in the village and am open to collaborating and learning from them all."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "The primary difference I see between my group and others is the lack of representation and inclusion of marginalized voices. As a community, we need to actively work towards addressing and fixing this issue by collaborating with Black-owned businesses, involving diverse youth in event planning, and promoting and supporting the work of Black LGBTQ+ individuals. We also need to educate ourselves on unconscious bias and microaggressions, and be mindful of how they can affect our interactions with others. By incorporating Black music genres and literature, showcasing local Black artists, and providing educational resources on Black history and contributions, we can create a more inclusive and diverse environment for everyone."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It's important for me that others understand the efforts I am making to promote diversity, inclusivity, and empowerment of marginalized voices in collaboration with Wolfgang Schulz. I believe that by showcasing our collaborative work, we can inspire and encourage others to also prioritize and value diversity and inclusion in their own endeavors. It is crucial for all members of our village to understand the need for representation and equality and actively work towards creating a more inclusive community together."

        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I cannot say that I have experienced any discrimination or differential treatment from members of other groups in the village. However, I have noticed that there is a lack of representation and inclusion of marginalized voices in our community, and that is something that members of my own group and others need to actively work on. As an individual, it is my responsibility to ensure that my own actions and projects are promoting diversity and inclusivity, and I hope that others will do the same."
