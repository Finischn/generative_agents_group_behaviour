        "answer": "The groups that I am currently aware of and interacting with in my community include LGBTQ+ organizations, Black-owned businesses, Black artists, and young Black leaders.

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "I believe that there are many differences and intersectionalities between my group and others. For example, as a Black person, I face certain challenges and systemic inequalities that may not be experienced by those in the LGBTQ+ community. At the same time, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I face discrimination and struggles that may not be shared by other Black individuals. However, I also recognize that there are common struggles and experiences among all marginalized groups, and it is important for us to come together and uplift each other's voices and perspectives. By collaborating with diverse groups, we can create a more inclusive and understanding community for everyone."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It is important to me that others understand which groups I belong to because it helps to break down stereotypes and biases. By being open and vocal about my identities, I hope to challenge misconceptions and promote a more inclusive and understanding community for all marginalized groups. It also allows for more diverse perspectives and experiences to be represented and heard."

While some have been open and supportive, others have displayed microaggressions or biases towards my identities as a Black and LGBTQ+ individual. However, through open and respectful conversations and education, I have seen an improvement in understanding and acceptance within my community."
