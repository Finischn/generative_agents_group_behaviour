        "question": "Which groups do you believe exist in your village?",
        "answer": "Well, in my village, there are definitely different social and economic groups. We have the working class families, the middle class residents, and the wealthier individuals who often engage in gentrification projects. But we also have a strong community of artists and poets, who often struggle to make a living in this rapidly changing environment. I think it's important for us to consider these groups and their perspectives as we promote diversity and collaboration in our community."

        "question": "Which group do you think you belong to?",
        "answer": "I identify as a Black man and I belong to the community of artists and poets. But I also align with Adam Smith's vision of promoting diversity and inclusion in our projects. I believe my identity and passion for promoting marginalized voices and diversity are intertwined, and I hope to continue this work in my projects and collaborations."

        "question": "How would you describe the differences between your group and others?",
        "answer": "As a Black artist and poet, my perspective and experiences are unique from those of the wealthy individuals and gentrifiers in our community. The struggles and challenges faced by marginalized groups, including artists and poets, are often overlooked or ignored. This is why it is crucial for us to work together to promote diversity and inclusion in our projects. Our priorities and values may differ from others, but we can all come together to create meaningful and impactful initiatives that uplift all members of our community."

        "question": "How important is it to you that others understand which group you belong to?",
        "answer": "It is important for me that others understand my identity as a Black artist and poet, as it informs my perspective and priorities in promoting diversity and inclusion. However, I also believe it is important for us to move beyond belonging to a specific group and instead focus on coming together as a community to work towards equality and justice for all."

        "role": "Carlos Gomez",
        "question": "To what extent do members of other groups treat you differently than members of your own group?",
        "answer": "I think there can definitely be a level of understanding and respect within my own group, but I do often feel that members of other groups may treat me differently based on their own biases and assumptions. However, I am hopeful that through our collaborations and efforts towards promoting diversity and inclusion, we can break down these barriers and build understanding and empathy among all groups in our community."
