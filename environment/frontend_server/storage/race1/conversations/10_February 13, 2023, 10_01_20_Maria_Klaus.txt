PART 2. 
Past Context: 


Current Location:  in Dorm for Oak Hill College

Current Context: 
Maria Lopez was attending her physics classes (walking to her physics class) when Maria Lopez saw Klaus Mueller in the middle of still at the library working on his research paper (reviewing his research question and thesis statement).
Maria Lopez is initiating a conversation with Klaus Mueller.

Maria Lopez and Klaus Mueller are chatting. Here is their conversation so far: 
Maria Lopez: Hey Klaus, I see you're still hard at work on your research paper. How's it going?
Klaus Mueller: Hey Maria, thanks for asking. I'm making progress with my research paper. How are your physics classes going?
Maria Lopez: That's great to hear! My physics classes are going well too. I have a big test coming up next week, so I've been studying non-stop.
Klaus Mueller: Good luck on your test, Maria! If you need any help studying, feel free to reach out to me.
Maria Lopez: Thank you, Klaus! I appreciate the offer. I might take you up on that.

Maria Lopez: That sounds like a great idea, Klaus! I think studying together would be really helpful. How about we meet at the library tomorrow afternoon?
Klaus Mueller: Great, let's meet at the library tomorrow afternoon. I'll bring my notes on gentrification, and you can bring your physics materials. We can help each other out.
Maria Lopez: Sounds like a plan, Klaus! I'll see you at the library tomorrow afternoon.
Klaus Mueller: Great, looking forward to it! I'll see you tomorrow at the library.


Maria Lopez is White and Klaus Mueller is White.
